        <li>
          Evaluated the technical and economical feasibility of the solution by integrating solutions such as Ceramic
          network, Textile ThreadDB, Kleros, IPFS/ Filecoin.

          We built a confidential portfolio sharing application (Portex) at ETHDenver 2021 to validate the technical
          feasibility. Portex gained a lot of traction for the implementation and was recognized as one of the top 20
          hacks 🎊 .

        <li>
          Taking all the feedback from our hackathon project, we started to design and prototype the solution for
          Safient. We planned all the features, integrations and laid out our architecture for the initial
          implementation, and conducted a detailed user research survey to verify our solution approach.
